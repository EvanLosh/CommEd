        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>CommEd is a forum for users to share and discuss their solutions to math problems. Not just math, but physics, engineering, and chemistry, as well. It's perfect for teachers and students who need to write and share solutions to their homework assignments.</p>
        <p>I am creating CommEd by myself as a project for my portfolio as an aspiring software engineer. On the front-end, I use React, Formik, react-tex, and markdownjs. On the back-end, I use Flask and SQLalchemy.</p>
